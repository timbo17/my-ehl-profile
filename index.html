                <p>Coming from the picturesque town of Rapperswil-Jona, I have always been a devoted hockey player, with a deep-rooted passion for the sport. Over the years, I've proudly represented my hometown team, showing unwavering dedication and a true love for the game. As a former player of the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers, I've embraced the camaraderie of the team and relished the opportunity to contribute to our local hockey legacy.</p>
